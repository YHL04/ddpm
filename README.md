# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)

A Generative Model that outperform GANs in terms of compute and benchmarks.

Predecessor of many state of the art generative models such as DALLE and Stable Diffusion

Code modified from different repositories

(Not Fixed: Cosine noise schedule worse than linear noise schedule)


## Results (50 epochs):
