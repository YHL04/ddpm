# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) for image generation

A Generative Model that outperform GANs in terms of compute and benchmarks.

Predecessor of many state of the art generative models such as DALLE and Stable Diffusion.

## Improved DDPM Changes

[ ] Learning: Changing loss function and variance formula

[X] Cosine Schedule

[ ] Importance Sampling

[X] Faster Sampling by changing number of timesteps
